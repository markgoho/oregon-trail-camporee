Beware, Scouts! Bandits lurk in the shadows, ready to ambush and steal your hard-earned Pioneer Tokens and supplies. You'll need to be vigilant, resourceful, and quick on your feet to outsmart these cunning foes.

## Ambush Points

Designate specific locations along the trail between stations as ambush points where bandits may hide. When a patrol reaches an ambush point, have an adult leader or volunteer act as the bandit, who can then challenge the patrol.

## Bandit Challenges

Bandits can engage in various challenges with the patrols, such as a quickdraw shootout, a tomahawk throwing contest, or a riddle-solving face-off. If the patrol wins the challenge, they successfully defend their Pioneer Tokens and items. If the bandit wins, they steal a predetermined amount of Pioneer Tokens or an item from the patrol.

## Ransom

When a bandit steals items or Pioneer Tokens, the patrol can negotiate a ransom to regain their stolen goods. The ransom can be part of the patrol's Pioneer Tokens or completing a challenge or task.

## Bandit Truce

If a patrol encounters a bandit, they can offer Pioneer Tokens or an item to the bandit in exchange for safe passage, avoiding a challenge altogether.

## Bandit Clues

Provide patrols with clues or hints about potential bandit ambush points so that they can prepare or strategize accordingly. The clues can be rewarded at stations or found along the trail.
