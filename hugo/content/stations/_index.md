Patrols will have seven stations to move between during the day. Each station will test their scout skills, teamwork, and scout spirit. Patrols will be awarded tokens at the end of each challenge based on their performance. Stations will have helpful and penalty cards that patrols will draw from before they start the challenge. Scouts can also use their tokens to gain advantages.
